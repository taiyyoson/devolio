A coauthored publication submitted to ACM CHI 2026 exploring the design and evaluation of Nala, an AI-powered health coaching chatbot. Nala guides users through a structured 4-week wellness program for stress management and habit building, combining a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline with evidence-based coaching principles.

## System Architecture

Nala operates through three layers: a React Native mobile frontend, a FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL, and a RAG pipeline using pgvector for semantic search over a curated coaching example database. The system retrieves contextually relevant coaching examples before generating responses through large language models.

## Research Focus

The work investigates how conversational AI can deliver accessible, personalized health coaching at scale — examining user engagement, coaching effectiveness, and the role of retrieval-augmented generation in producing grounded, contextually appropriate wellness guidance.
